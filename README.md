A project made using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node, MongoDB, Express that gives you information about campgrounds around your area.
This Project was part of an online course that I completed, namely "Web Developer Bootcamp", and includes full CRUD functionality, as well as a responsive design
This was made completely from scratch, without the use of any plagiarized data.
